# Go Quickfix Script

This script uses `gopls` to find and apply quickfixes to all `.go` files in a specified directory.

## Usage Example

1. Ensure you have `gopls` installed and available in your `$GOPATH/bin`.
2. Run the script with the path to the directory containing your Go files:
```go
    go run main.go /path/to/your/go/project
```
